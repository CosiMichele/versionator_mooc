Self Assessment Questions
````````````````````````````

  .. admonition:: Question
       :class: admonition-question

       Q1. What is cyberinfrastructure?

       .. admonition:: Answer

          Cyberinfrastructure is more than just an online computing platform.
          It's the combination of computing and data management tools along
          with training and support. Making these tools work nicely together
          and giving you the training and help you need to get work done is the
          goal for CyVerse.


  .. admonition:: Question
       :class: admonition-question

       Q2. True or false: you need to know how to use the command line to use CyVerse

       A. True
       B. False

       .. admonition:: Answer

          FALSE. There are some tools and services where you can use a command
          line interface if you desire, but most tools and services don't
          require you to use any command line interface.

  .. admonition:: Question
       :class: admonition-question

       Q3. How does CyVerse US differ from other CyVerse installations?


       .. admonition:: Answer

          CyVerse US is the original and main CyVerse platform, the one you
          will visit if you are using any platform served by cyverse.org.
          CyVerse US generally has the broadest set of tools and services.
          While anyone can get a free account, there may be some limitations
          for non-US users.
