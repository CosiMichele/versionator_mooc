Interactive Analyses
-----------------------

    .. admonition:: learning-objectives

       - Know how to request VICE access.
       - Know how to launch and access VICE application.
       - Understand how to configure the VICE application and run an analysis.
       - Save the outputs of a VICE application to your Data Store.



**Description:**

The Visual Interactive Computing Environment (|VICE|) allows you to work with
popular interactive data science applications such JupyterLab, RStudio, Linux
shell and others. In this exercise we will cover a simple introductory use case
that allows us to complete our goal of visualizing a phylogenetic tree.

*In this exercise we will:*

  1. Launch an RStudio session, loading the sequence alignments created earlier
     in the course.
  2. Install an R package and create a phylogenetic tree from the alignment,
     saving it to a file.
  3. Save our work to the Data Store and terminate the application.


.. tip::

   **Why use VICE?**

   The Discovery Environment excels at running compute intensive analyses non-
   interactively. In other words, once you launch a job in the DE, you get an
   output, but to start a new analysis (for example to tweak parameters), you
   need to relaunch that job, and await new results. This style of computing
   allows you to run large jobs that require lots of resources. However,
   several analyses we’d like to do are interactive – we need to visualize and
   manipulate parameters on the fly – for example, creating a figure where you
   need to see and adjust the results of an upstream analysis. This kind of
   work is often done using tools like R and RStudio, or other programing tools
   such as Jupyter. Hence VICE!

**Input Data:**

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Input
      - Description
      - Example
    * - The output of a multiple species DNA sequence alignment from MUSCLE
      - We will use a multiple alignment generated in the Discovery Environment
        by the MUSCLE App in the previous sections to generate a phylogenetic tree using some tools in R.
      - View the example |MUSCLE output folder|.

*Getting VICE Access*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To minimize inappropriate use, VICE is a restricted service, currently
accessible from CyVerse US. You must request access to use.


  1. Visit the |CyVerse User Portal| and access the |services panel|; look for
     **DE – VICE** and select the **REQUST ACCESS** link.

     .. tip::

        Ensure that your CyVerse account is associated with an |ORCID| and a
        valid email address from an organization (i.e., .org, an educational
        institution with the .edu ending, or a government .gov). We will not
        grant access to commercial email addresses, e.g., @gmail.com @yahoo.com
        @msn.com etc.


*Launching a VICE application*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. If necessary, log into the CyVerse |Discovery Environment|.

  2. Use this quicklaunch link |CyVerse_rocker_launch| or click on |Apps icon|
     (Apps icon) to launch the **Rocker RStudio Latest** App. You can also use
     the DE search bar to search for this application in the Apps category.

     .. tip::

        We provide and maintain the latest versions of R and RStudio made
        available by the |Rocker Project|.

  3. Launch the application and adjust the following:

      a. Under "Analysis Info", add comments if desired; click **Next**;
      b. For "Parameters", under “Input Folder” click **Browse** and navigate
         to the **tutorial_folder** and select the **muscle_output** folder
         where your Muscle analysis results should be located; click **Select
         Current Folder**; then **Next**;
       c. Click **Next** to skip Advanced Settings;
       d. Click **Launch Analysis** to launch your application

  4. At this point you will be redirected to the Analyses menu. Your
     application will be listed as “Submitted” for a few minutes (usually just
     a few, but more depending on both the size of the application software and
     any imported datasets).

  5. When the Status of the launch is Running, click on the |Link out icon|
     (link out Icon); a new tab where your VICE application will run should open in your browser.

     .. tip::

        Even once the application is in the Running status, you may still have to wait some additional time if data is being transferred


*Completing our analysis in R*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have your RStudio session, it will largely behave as would an RStudio
session running on your local Desktop. Some potential benefits of running
RStudio in VICE include more processing power (especially if you choose
additional resources at launch – see the Advanced Settings).  Since this
session is running on CyVerse hardware, transferring large data will also
happen at increased speed. To complete our analyses, we will install the |ape package| and compute a phylogenetic tree.

 .. tip::
   While you don’t need to be an expert R user to complete this section,
   familiarity with R will help since we won’t be going into specific detail
   about this example.

 .. tip::
  The data we loaded at launch of the VICE application will be in the ‘work’
  directory at ‘home’.

1. From the R console, we will do the following commands:

     .. code-block:: language

       # install and load the needed R library
       install.packages("ape")
       library(ape)

       #Read in the aligned DNA fasta file
       alignment <- read.FASTA ("~/work/02_muscle_output/fasta.aln", type="DNA")

       # Create a distance matrix for the sequences
       dist_mtrx <- dist.dna(alignment)

       #Compute a neighbor-joining tree
       nj_tree <- nj(dist_mtrx)

       # plot the tree
       plot.phylo(nj_tree)

       # save the tree to a file
       write.tree(nj_tree, file = "~/work/tree.newick")

2. You should have visualized the resulting tree and also created the file ‘tree.newick’ in your work directory


Terminating your VICE session and saving work to the Data Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have completed your work, you can save your work to the Data Store and terminate your VICE application.

  .. tip::

     VICE applications typically have a 48-hour run time. Unless you request an
     extension, your application will automatically save outputs. It is
     recommended that you save your work to the Data Store before time expires.

 1. In the Analyses pane of the Discovery Environment, select your running
    RStudio VICE application.

 2. Under **More Actions**, select **Terminate**; confirm Termination on the
    pop-up notice.

 3. When the VICE application has the status completed, click the folder icon
    to view the folder on your data store where results will be written. It may
    take time for all outputs to be saved depending on the size of the data
    generated.

    .. tip::

       You don't have to terminate your analyses to save your work to the Data
       Store. From within the RStudio environment using the terminal, you can
       use iCommands to transfer data (See |Data Store Guide| on iCommands).
       RStudio itself allows you to download files and plots directly to
       your local computer. Use the Export features present in the file pane.
