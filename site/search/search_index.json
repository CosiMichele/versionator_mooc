Answer Cyberinfrastructure is more than just an online computing platform. It's the combination of computing and data management tools along with training and support. Making these tools work nicely together and giving you the training and help you need to get work done is the goal for CyVerse. You need to know how to use the command line to use CyVerse True or False Answer FALSE. There are some tools and services where you can use a command line interface if you desire, but most tools and services don't require you to use any command line interface. How does CyVerse USA differ from other CyVerse installations? Answer CyVerse US is the original and main CyVerse platform, the one you will visit if you are using any platform served by cyverse.org. CyVerse US generally has the broadest set of tools and services. While anyone can get a free account, there may be some limitations for non-US users.

Here is a link to the FAIR Data assessment tool mentioned in the video. Downloading data from the Discovery Environment \u00b6 Dropdown Menu The dropdown menu allows you to navigate between your home directory in the Data Store (i.e. your username), and other CyVerse data collections such as files shared with you (i.e. \"Shared with Me\"), and files shared by the CyVerse community (i.e.\"Community Data\"). You may also access files located in your \"Trash\" folder. If necessary, log into the Discovery Environment . Click the Data Icon to browse your collection of files in the Data Store. In the top left of the page, you should see your username with a dropdown arrow next to it; Click on your username, then click Community Data in the dropdown menu. From the Community Data directory, scroll down until you find cyverse_training/ folder, and click on it. Then navigate to the cyverse_mooc / folder, then muscle_3_8_31/01_muscle_input , which contains example data.

Click on the More Actions button on the upper right and select the Download option to download the file to your local computer. Downloads in the browser We don't recommend downloading many (more than 10) or large (more than 2GB) files directly from the Discovery Environment at one time. Since files transferred in this way make use of HTML protocols these are slower and more often subject to failure for larger data sets. Cyberduck or iCommands (discussed below and in the next section) are recommended for these uses. Uploading a File to the Discovery Environment \u00b6 On your computer, use any text editor to create a file called README.txt . You may wish to save it in the same place you have the DE_sample_plants.fas file (i.e. your Desktop, Downloads, etc.). In the README.txt file, add several pieces of information about the DE_sample_plants.fas file you just downloaded: Name of file: `DE_sample_plants.fas` Type of file: `FASTA` file containing DNA sequences Type of organism: plants Adding a simple README with this sort of information can quickly make your data more FAIR . setting file type Make sure you save this as a plain text file ( .txt ), other file formats (e.g. .docx ) may not be rendered in the Discovery Environment editor. In the Discovery Environment, click the Data Icon to access your home folder; you can access this from the same dropdown menu where you previously selected Community Data . Navigate to the tutorial_folder directory you created earlier. Click the Upload icon in the upper right, then select Browse Local . Then navigate to your README.txt file and select it. It may take a moment, but your README.txt file should now be uploaded to your tutorial_folder on the Data Store; you may need to refresh your web browser to see the update.

A Fixable, Assessable, Interpretable, Recyclable B Fast Access In Repetition C Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable D Fixable, Automated, Intersectional, Reducible Answer The correct answer is C True or False is FAIR data is the same as Open data? Answer False. Open data must be free for use and distribution by anyone, whereas data can be limited in access while still being FAIR. Likewise, Open data are not necessarily easily findable,interoperable, or reusable. Which of the following are NOT true of the process of making your data FAIR? A It will be the same regardless of discipline B It may require some technical skills C It can be easier with CyVerse D It happens on a continuum, not a binary FAIR/not FAIR Answer The correct answer is A Making your data FAIR can vary widely by discipline. For example, human health data may be subject to stricter security and more limited sharing, which must be accounted for when attempting to make data FAIR. True or False is adding a README file a quick way to make your data more FAIR? Answer True , a README can provide quick access to metadata and is easily discovered within a given directory.

Launch and access VICE application. Configure the VICE application and run an analysis. Save the outputs of a VICE application to your Data Store. Description: The Visual Interactive Computing Environment VICE allows you to work with popular interactive data science applications such JupyterLab, RStudio, Linux shell and others. In this exercise we will cover a simple introductory use case that allows us to complete our goal of visualizing a phylogenetic tree. In this exercise we will: Launch an RStudio session, loading the sequence alignments created earlier in the course. Install an R package and create a phylogenetic tree from the alignment, saving it to a file. Save our work to the Data Store and terminate the application. Why use VICE The Discovery Environment excels at running compute intensive analyses non-interactively. In other words, once you launch a job in the DE, you get an output, but to start a new analysis (for example to tweak parameters), you need to relaunch that job, and await new results. This style of computing allows you to run large jobs that require lots of resources. However, several analyses we'd like to do are interactive -- we need to visualize and manipulate parameters on the fly -- for example, creating a figure where you need to see and adjust the results of an upstream analysis. This kind of work is often done using tools like R and RStudio, or other programing tools such as Jupyter. Hence VICE! Input Data \u00b6 Location File Example muscle_output/ logs folder View the example muscle_output/ clstalw.aln fasta.aln phylip_interleaved.aln phylip_sequential.aln Getting VICE Access \u00b6 To minimize inappropriate use, VICE is a restricted service, currently accessible from CyVerse US. You must request access to use. Visit the User Portal and Services ; look for DE VICE and select the REQUST ACCESS link. Ensure your request is approved Ensure that your CyVerse account is associated with a valid email address from an organization ending with .org , an educational institution with .edu , or government .gov . We do not grant access to commercial email addresses, e.g., @gmail.com @yahoo.com @msn.com etc. Launching a VICE application \u00b6 Featured Apps CyVerse maintains featured apps from the Rocker-Project , Project Jupyter , and Visual Studio Code quick launch Base Images Rocker-Project Project Jupyter Visual Studio Code These containers are built from community maintianed container stacks, with a few additonal packages for use in CyVerse DE. If necessary, log into the Discovery Environment . Click the Data Icon and navigate to your results/ folder in the tutorial_folder/ ; click the (Add Folder button) and create a folder called rocker_output/ inside your tutorial folder. Use this Quick Launch link or click on Apps to launch thev featured Rocker RStudio Latest App. You can also use the DE search bar to search for this application in the Apps category. Launch the application and adjust the following: Under \"Analysis Info\", for Output Folder click Browse and navigate to and select the rocker_output created above. click Next ; For \"Parameters\", under \"Input Folder\" click Browse and navigate to the tutorial_folder , then the results folder and select the muscle_output folder where your Muscle analysis results should be located; click Select Current Folder ; then Next ; Click Next to skip Advanced Settings; Click Launch Analysis to launch your application In the navigation, click on the (Analyses) view. Your application will be listed as \"Submitted\" for a few minutes (usually just a few, but more depending on both the size of the application software and any imported datasets). When the Status of the launch is Running, click on the (link out icon); a new tab where your VICE application will run should open in your browser. Launching VICE Apps Even when the application has entered 'Running' status, you may still have to wait some additional time for input data to be transferred onto the resource with the new container. Completing our analysis in R \u00b6 Once you have your RStudio session, it will behave the same as a RStudio session running on your local Desktop. Some potential benefits of running RStudio in VICE include more processing power (especially if you choose additional resources at launch -- see the Advanced Settings). Since this session is running on CyVerse hardware, transferring large data will also happen at increased speed. To complete our analyses, we will install the ape package and compute a phylogenetic tree. Using RStudio While you don't need to be an expert R user to complete this section, familiarity with R will help since we won't be going into specific detail about this example. Locating your files in RStudio The data we loaded at launch of the VICE application will be in the /home/rstudio/work/data/input directory. From the R console, enter the following commands: script.r # install and load the needed R library install.packages(\"ape\") library(ape) #Read in the aligned DNA fasta file alignment <- read.FASTA (\"~/work/data/input/muscle_output/fasta.aln\", type=\"DNA\") # Create a distance matrix for the sequences dist_mtrx <- dist.dna(alignment) #Compute a neighbor-joining tree nj_tree <- nj(dist_mtrx) # plot the tree plot.phylo(nj_tree) # save the tree to a file write.tree(nj_tree, file = \"~/work/data/output/tree.newick\") #OR save to your CyVerse Data Store directly in the file browser write.tree(nj_tree, file = \"~/work/home/YOUR_CYVERSE_USERNAME/tutorial_folder/rocker_output/tree.newick\") You should have visualized the resulting tree and also created the file tree.newick in your work directory. Terminating your VICE session and saving work to the Data Store \u00b6 Once you have completed your work, you can save your work to the Data Store and terminate your VICE application. Extending Analysis Time VICE applications typically have a 48-hour run time. Unless you request an extension, your application will save data in the ~/work/data/outputs folder to your analyses/ folder when it terminates. It is recommended that you save your work to the Data Store before time expires. In the Analyses pane of the Discovery Environment, select your unning RStudio VICE application. Under More Actions , select Terminate ; confirm Termination on the pop-up notice. When the VICE application has the status completed, click the folder icon to view the folder on your data store where results will be written. It may take time for all outputs to be saved depending on the size of the data generated. Transfering your data You don't have to terminate your analyses to save your work to the Data Store. From within the RStudio environment using the terminal, you can use iCommands to transfer data (See Data Store Guide on iCommands). RStudio does allow you to download files and plots directly back to your local computer. Use the \"Export\" features present in the file pane. Output/Results Output Description Example tree.newick A Newick-formatted phylogenetic tree file which can visualized using your choice of tools.
