## Editing Metadata on Single Files in the Discovery Environment


1.  If necessary, log into the CyVerse .

2.  Click the (Data Icon) to browse your collection of files in the CyVerse Data Store.

3.  Navigate to the `raw_data` folder inside `tutorial_folder` and select (checkbox) the `DE_sample_plants.fas` file uploaded previously.

4.  Under the **More Actions** menu, click on the **Metadata** choice.

You will see existing metadata for the file/folder in the Attribute, Value, Unit (AVU) format.

### Adding metadata

1.  Click the "+ Add Metadata" button to add a new entry. Then follow the directions for editing metadata below.

### Editing or deleting metadata

1.  Use the "pencil" icon to edit an existing entry or the "trash can" icon to delete an entry.

2.  After you have made any edits or deletion, click 'Save' (on the top right of the screen) to save all entries and apply the metadata.

### Apply metadata on multiple files in the Discovery Environment

It is possible to add or edit metadata on multiple files in the Discovery Environment by uploading a spreadsheet with this metadata. 

The spreadsheet can be designed to follow a metadata format or standard, or contain whatever metadata entries you want associated with a set of files. See the for more details.

## Output/Results

  Output                                              Description                                                                                                                                                Example
  --------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **DE\_sample\_plants.fas** with metadata applied.   Although the file itself has not been edited, viewing the metadata in the Discovery Environment lets you view all annotations you have made to the file.   View with metadata applied (you will need to view the file in the Discovery Environment to view the associated metadata; select the file and click **More Actions** and then **Metadata**).

## Data Sharing in the Discovery Environment

1.  If necessary, log into the CyVerse .

2.  Click the (Data Icon) to browse your collection of files in the CyVerse Data Store.

3.  Navigate to the `tutorial_folder/` created previously and select (checkbox) the folder. Click the **Share** button.

4.  In the 'search for users' field search for the CyVerse user you wish to share with by searching for their username or email address.

5.  Next, under 'Permissions' choose what permission you want to grant the person you are sharing this file with.

??? Tip "See more on in the Data Store Guide."

6.  Once you are finished, click Done to begin sharing. The user will be notified that a file has been shared with them.
