*Upload data using the Discovery Environment*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. If necessary, log into the CyVerse |Discovery Environment|.

2. Click on the |Data icon| (data icon) to access the Data window in the
   Discovery Environment.

3.  In the Data window you will see a directory of files and folders in your
    Data Store. You may select a folder to be the destination for your uploaded
    file(s). You may also click the Folder button to create a new folder. If
    you do not select a destination, files will be uploaded by default to your
    home Data Store folder (i.e., iplant/home/CYVERSE_USERNAME)

4. Click the Upload button to choose your options for importing files into the
   Discovery Environment:

   - To upload files from your local computer, choose Browse Local; a file
     browser will open and you may select files to upload (2 GB Max)
   - To upload files available at a URL, choose Import by URL; You may paste in
     a valid HTTP or an FTP URL. Then press Import. You may paste additional
     URLs or close this window by clicking Done.

5. Once you have begun the upload, you will get an automated notification that
   files have been queued for upload. You may also view the status of an upload
   or import by going back to the Upload button and choosing View Upload Queue.
